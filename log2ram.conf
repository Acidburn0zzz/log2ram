# Configuration file for Log2Ram (https://github.com/azlux/log2ram) under MIT license.
# This configuration file is read by the log2ram service
# Size for the ram folder, it's define the size the log folder will reserve into the RAM. If it's not enough, log2ram will not be able to use ram. Check you /var/log size folder. The default is 40M and is basically enough for a lot of application. You will need to increase it if you have a server and a lot of log for example.

SIZE=40M

# This variable can be set to true if you prefer "rsync" than "cp". I use the command cp -u and rsync -X, so I don't copy the all folder every time for optimization.
# You can choose which one you want. Be sure rsync is installed if you use it.

USE_RSYNC=false

# If there are some error with available RAM space, a system mail will be send
# Change it to false, and you will have only log if there are no place on RAM anymore.

MAIL=true
